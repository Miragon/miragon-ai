/**
 * Synchronously runs every executable job for a given process instance (and
 * every sub-process reached via call activity) until the list is empty or the
 * retry counter drains. Split out of [SeedOrchestrator] so the seeders can
 * inject it without forming a constructor-injection cycle (orchestrator →
 * seeders → orchestrator).
 *
 * Queries by `rootProcessInstanceId` instead of `processInstanceId` so the
 * asyncBefore blacklist job in `assessCreditworthiness` — which runs under the
 * *sub-process* PI — is drained alongside the parent's SendPolicy job.
 *
 * `.executable()` skips timer jobs whose due date is still in the future — a
 * must for `Activity_DecideOnApplication`, whose 2 h non-interrupting boundary
 * timer the normal path must *not* fire.
