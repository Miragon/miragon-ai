/**
 * A deployment resource's name, refused unless it reaches the engine UNCHANGED.
 * The engine names the deployed resource after the multipart filename and keys
 * the deployment's resources by it, so a name rewritten in transit is deployed
 * under another name, and two distinct names can collapse into one that the
 * engine keeps only once (past the uniqueness check below). Each rule closes
 * one rewrite:
 * - `"` and line breaks: fetch percent-escapes them in the filename, so
 *   `a"b` arrives as `a%22b`, the same as a literal `a%22b`;
 * - leading or trailing whitespace: the engine's multipart parser
 *   (commons-fileupload) trims the filename, and a blank name arrives empty;
 * - `=?`: that parser decodes RFC 2047 encoded words in the filename;
 * - `\`: the quoted-string escape, which multipart parsers disagree on;
 * - control characters: never part of a file name (a NUL fails the upload).
 * Non-ASCII names travel as raw UTF-8, which the engine decodes with its JVM
 * default charset (UTF-8 since Java 18).
