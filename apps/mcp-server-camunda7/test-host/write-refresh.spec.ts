/**
 * #341 in the BUILT bundle, behind the minimal SEP-1865 host (see
 * test-host/README.md): an in-widget write in a STANDALONE show view
 * refreshes the view. The tool result the host delivered is the seed of the
 * view's feed query — not a frozen snapshot — so the write's targeted
 * invalidation re-reads the feed through the host's `tools/call` and the view
 * re-renders, without the host re-executing the rendering tool. Guards the
 * whole chain the unit suites only fake: the seed lands in the ONE query
 * client the bundle shares (vite `dedupe`), the write goes through the host,
 * the refetch reaches the server's app-only feed.
 *
 * Runs on the `camunda7:operations` deployment (`HOST_SIM_OPERATIONS_URL`) —
 * the read-only default offers no write — against the stub engine's one
 * failed job, which this scenario owns.
