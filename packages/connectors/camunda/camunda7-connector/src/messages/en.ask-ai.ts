/**
 * The Ask-AI hand-off intents (#338): the SHORT task each widget hands to the
 * agent as the user's message. Static text on purpose — no parameters, no data,
 * no tool names: ids, on-screen numbers, engine text and the deployment's
 * tools are added by `askAiPrompt` (ids inlined only when id-shaped, engine
 * text fenced as untrusted data, tools filtered by the live surface). Generic
 * playbooks (engine pinning, the guarded remediation) live in the module's
 * server instructions, not here.
 *
 * Plain English in the operator's voice (it posts as their message): no dash
 * connectors, no verdicts in capitals, the guardrail ending ("Change nothing.")
 * kept. The button labels and icons live in the kit (`HandOffButton`, GLOSSARY.md).
