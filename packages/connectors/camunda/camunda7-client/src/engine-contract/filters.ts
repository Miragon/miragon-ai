/**
 * Query filters. Two engine behaviours turn a plausible filter into a silent
 * no-op, so the tools never forward a filter value as given:
 *
 * - Boolean filters are TRUE-ONLY: `true` narrows the result, `false` is
 *   IGNORED (HTTP 200, no filter) — neither a negation nor a 400. A forwarded
 *   `suspended=false` would return the suspended instances to a caller who
 *   asked for the opposite. Flags go out only when `true`; where the engine
 *   has the complementary flag (active/suspended, finished/unfinished, …), a
 *   `false` is sent as `true` on the other side instead.
 * - `…Like` filters are SQL LIKE patterns: without a `%` they match the whole
 *   value exactly, so "substring" search silently became an exact match.
