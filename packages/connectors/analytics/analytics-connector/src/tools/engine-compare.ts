      "Compare ONE process definition as it runs on two configured CIB Seven engines (e.g. prod-a vs prod-b) over a shared rolling window, from metrics. processDefinitionKey is required: engines host different process mixes, so comparing their whole workloads would measure the mix rather than the engines — holding the process fixed is what makes the delta attributable. Returns per engine starts, completions, incidents per 100 starts (with activityId also at that element) and avg/p95 duration of the instances that ENDED, plus the deltas. Flagged `suppressed` when either engine has fewer than minBucketSize started or completed instances. For the unscoped cross-engine picture (what runs where, load, job backlog, which keys are deployed on several engines) use analytics_engine_landscape first; its `sharedProcessKeys` are the valid inputs here.",
