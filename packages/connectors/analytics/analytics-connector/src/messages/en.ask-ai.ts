/**
 * The analytics Ask-AI hand-off intents (#338): the SHORT task each widget
 * hands to the agent as the user's message. Static text on purpose — no
 * parameters, no data, no tool names: ids, on-screen numbers, engine text and
 * the deployment's tools are added by `askAiPrompt` (ids inlined only when
 * id-shaped, engine text fenced as untrusted data, tools filtered by the live
 * surface). Generic rules (never compare a rate across engines, `suppressed`
 * means noise) live in the module's server instructions, not here.
 *
 * Posted in the user's name, so it reads like a person asking: plain words,
 * no dash as a connector, the guardrail ending ("Change nothing.") kept.
